ASK : When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

SAY : When working in collobration, or to have access and share files more easily.

ASK : Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

SAY : This way you have more freedom on making your code available to others. If
its done automatically in regular intervals the code might have unchecked
bugs or could be right in middle of production.

ASK : Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

SAY : Forks are direct cloning of a github repo to your own repo. Clone is cloning
a repo to your local machine. Branches are versions that you create for your repo.
